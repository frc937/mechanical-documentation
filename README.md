# Build Season Schedule

This is a rough schedule of what build season should look like. It's gonna look fast, but that's just how FRC is. You won't believe how much you can get done working as many hours a week as you will.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**STICK TO THIS SCHEDULE**, no matter when competition is. Extra time beyond the 6 weeks should be used for driver/pit practice.
{% endhint %}

## Before Build Season

* Make sure the shop is ready for build season
  * Organize supplies
  * Make sure consumables for power tools are in good shape (i.e. bandsaw blade, chopsaw blade, etc)

## During Build Season

### Week 1

* On day 1, after designing the robot, break into subteams to tackle each individual mechanism. Break up the mechanisms as you see fit.
* Planning and prototyping
* Build frame based off of information recieved at kickoff
* Build the field element for gamepiece manipulation (e.g. the hub from the 2022 game)
  * This is something that parents/ mentors can do

### Week 2

* Work on gamepiece manipulation (e.g. ball shooting)
* Finish prototyping the complex endgame procedure that most games have (e.g. climbing from 2022 or 2020)
* Build the field element for the complicated endgame
  * Again, this is something parents can do

### Week 3

* Final touches on gamepiece manipulation
* Test gamepiece manipulation

### Week 4

* Do complicated endgame mechanism

### Week 5

* Final touches and assembly on the bot
* If you have time/ resources, this is where you do things like painting, powder coating, stickers, etcetera

### Week 6

* Stress testing
  * Marines-style hell day - beat. up. the. robot. Procedure page forthcoming.
* Pit and driver practice

### Any remaining time before competition

PRACTICE. PRACTICE. PRACTICE.

### Competition

Does this really need a section? It's comp. You'll know what to do by the time you make it here.

Also we'll have procedures for various different things related to competition.
